A web application using flask which uses MariaDB database for storage, so needs a server to run. XAMPP recommended because this program was tested using it.
A crude website created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap v4 to facilitate a GUI for the same. Server created using Flask framework of Python to facilitate database and routing operations.
