Flask-MysqlDB gives error while installing directly via pip.
So you have to install this wheel first. (mysqlclient.whl)
I have included that file here, do the following 
Right click in an empty area, do open PowerShell here or CMD here
Type the following command:
pip install <TAB>
File name should appear, let it install and then try "pip install flask-mysqldb" again and it should install.
